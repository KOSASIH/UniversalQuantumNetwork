# Getting Started with the Universal Quantum Network (UQN)

## Overview

This guide is designed to help new users and developers get started with the Universal Quantum Network (UQN). It covers the installation process, basic concepts, and how to run your first quantum communication experiment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A basic understanding of quantum mechanics.
- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your machine.
- Access to a quantum computing framework (e.g., Qiskit or Cirq).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   
   ```bash
   1 git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/UniversalQuantumNetwork.git
   2 cd UniversalQuantumNetwork
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Use pip to install the required packages.
   
   ```bash
   1 pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up the Environment**: Configure your environment variables as needed for your quantum computing framework.

## Running Your First Experiment

1. **Create a New Experiment**: Navigate to the experiments/ directory and create a new Python file for your experiment.

2. **Write Your Code**: Use the provided templates to set up your quantum circuit and define your communication protocol.

3. **Execute the Experiment**: Run your experiment using the following command:

   ```bash
   1 python your_experiment_file.py
   ```

4. **Analyze Results**: Review the output and logs generated by your experiment to understand the results.
