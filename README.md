   ```bash
   1 git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/UniversalQuantumNetwork.git
   2 cd UniversalQuantumNetwork
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**: It is recommended to use a virtual environment. You can create one using venv or conda.

   Using 'venv':

   ```bash
   1 python -m venv venv
   2 source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required packages using pip:

   ```bash
   1 pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
4. **Run Setup Script (if applicable)**: If there is a setup script, run it to configure the environment:

   ```bash
   1 bash setup_env.sh
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Example
To run a basic example of the UQN, execute the following command:

   ```bash
   1 python examples/basic_example.py
   ```

### Advanced Usage
For advanced usage scenarios, refer to the tutorials in the docs/tutorials/ directory. You can find guides on:

   - Setting up a quantum communication link
   - Integrating AI for network optimization
   - Implementing secure messaging protocols
